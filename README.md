# MusicJournal
Music Journal is an app which allows a music lover to diarise their music catalogue.  Music has deep meaning for people, and certain songs, albums, genres or artists evoke strong memories of events, people, feelings or places.  Music Journal helps them to organise their ultimate life playlist and write about those experiences, for personal reflection or to share with others. A completed catalogue would read almost as a novel of the userâ€™s life as enjoyed through music.
